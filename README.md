# Customer Churn Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on analysing and predicting customer churn in the telecom industry using machine learning techniques. The aim is to understand customer behaviour and build predictive models that can help businesses improve customer retention.

## Project Overview
Customer churn is a major challenge for telecom companies. In this project, historical customer data is analysed to identify churn patterns and predict whether a customer is likely to leave the service.

The project follows an end-to-end machine learning workflow, starting from data manipulation and visualisation to model building and evaluation.

## Dataset
The dataset contains telecom customer information, including:
- Customer tenure
- Monthly charges
- Contract type
- Payment method
- Churn status (Yes/No)

## Steps Performed
- Data loading and inspection using Pandas
- Data manipulation and filtering
- Exploratory data analysis and visualisation
- Model development and comparison using:
  - Linear Regression
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
- Model evaluation using RMSE, accuracy score, and confusion matrix

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab

## Key Outcome
The project demonstrates how machine learning models can be used to predict customer churn and highlights the effectiveness of ensemble models such as Random Forest for classification tasks.
